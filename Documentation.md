You work for a Travel Magazin and this Kanban will help you manage the tasks of the team.
A reporter creates a ticket for the assignee. Then the assignee takes this task and fulfils it by writing the article. 
The tickets are articles that can come to existence as an idea in the Todo column.
Once the assignee starts writing, he/she should move it to the In Progress column.
If it's ready to be published, it should be moved to the Completed column.

- be able to share a direct link to the ticket.
